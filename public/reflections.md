# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
    1. if-else loops! It's just a bit of syntax change from C++. It's the same principle and since if-else is easily visualizable by using things like flowcharts, its easy for me to do.
    2. switch! Mostly for the same reason as if-else. It's still simple in principle.
    3. basic html syntax! This is stuff like <p> and <h1>. It's easy to understand, and easy to apply!
    4. Arithmetic and Comparing operators. Also kind of basic. A lot of my knowledge comes from application last year and also common sense.
    5. Loops. They're so funny, people think they're complicated because they just think of it as text rather than process. No flex but, I enjoy problems that make me use loops. 
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
    1. CSS. Mostly in general though for the sake of the activity i'll break it down. This specific CSS topic are all of the tags i need to use like font-family, color, etc. because I keep forgetting them
    2. CSS. Animation! The jellyfish bonus was so hard for me. I like making websites but apparently not that good at making it.. fun to use? I think my problem is just the syntax.
    3. Functions in Javascript. Personally, I find them a bit complicated, especially when you need to make it functional in html. An example of this is the guess my word activity. My code is less readable, but this might come with time.
    4. CSS part 3. This is the design mentality. With Rei right beside me I realize that my design sense with CSS is.. to say not as amazing. 
    5. Making website ideas. I like to think I'm good at problem solving but I'm not good at problem finding. When I talked about it with my partner, it was really hard for me to think of website ideas
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
    1. When in doubt, use google! There's probably going to be a lot of resources 
    2. Try applying it. Personally, i've changed my website a bit based on things I want to learn.
    3. If step 2 doesn't work, there should be a website with a practice problem I can try!
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
    Application in any form is really useful for me like
    1. Practice (Bonus and also the activities)
    2. Quizzes

    But other than that, it's not that effective for me:
    1. Lectures unfortunately are not my cup of tea and I would rather learn by trying :P NO OFFENSE SIR UR A GREAT TEACHER
    2. what other methods were there..... i actually dont know :p
