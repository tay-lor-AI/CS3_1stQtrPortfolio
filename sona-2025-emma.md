1. The advertisment of EGov app 
> caught me off guard,,, NOT THAT ITS BAD

## Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

This SONA was an all rounder, mentioning problems from different aspects of the country. I liked that they gave possible solutions, I only wish they would have been more specific when describing the solutions. 

I had no expectations before watching the SONA, mostly because a lot of the time, not everything they said would actually happen. Now, I at least hope they are able to fully follow through with the latter part, specifically about the transparency for the flood control projects.
